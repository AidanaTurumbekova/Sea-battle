The game is a classic 'Battleship' played on a 7x7 grid. The computer secretly places the ships
(1 ship out of 3 squares, 2 ships out of 2 squares, and 4 ships out of 1 square),
ensuring that the ships do not touch, even at the corners. Players take turns entering coordinates (e.g. "B5") to attack,
with hits, misses, and sunk ships visually displayed.The board is updated after each action for clarity, 
and when the game is over, the program displays the total number of shots fired and asks if the player wants to start over. 
The leaderboard is saved and displayed upon exit. 
Bonus features include entering letters and numbers and preventing duplicate or invalid shots.
